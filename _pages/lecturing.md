Between Autumn 2019 and Summer 2021, I worked as a University Assistant at the Technical University of Moldova. Throughout this period, I was lecturing three courses:
- [Network Programming]({{ site.url }}/_data/NetworkProgrammingCourseAutumn2020.pdf), covering concurrency primitives and network protocols.
- [Real-Time Programming]({{ site.url }}/_data/RealTimeProgrammingCourseSpring2020.pdf), covering message-based concurrency paradigms, also with some off-topics related to scalability, parallelization, and [mechanical sympathy](https://dzone.com/articles/mechanical-sympathy).
- [Distributed Systems]({{ site.url }}/_data/DistributedSystemsCourseAutumn2020.pdf), covering both microservice and Big Data processing architectures patterns, and more fundamental problems of distributed systems (think delivery guarantees, consensus, and distributed transactions).

Plus, supervised some students pursuing their B.E.

I was teaching specifically at the anglophone branch, called [FAF](https://www.facebook.com/FAF.NGO/). It's considered a kind of "SpecOps" academic group, with numerous perks and a selection process in place to pick who will get in there and who won't. Because of this, I majorly "refactored" these courses, specifically for them, making these much more fast-paced and covering substantially more material, with some new complex practical projects (i.e. labs).

All courses were significantly updated, but Real-Time Programming is a different topic entirely. The Real-Time Programming course didn't exist in the form I was teaching it, so I made it from scratch. Originally it was a course about event-driven programming in Windows, the Win32 API mind you. My version of Real-Time Programming is about asynchronous (and synchronous, a bit) message-driven communication, actor model, message brokers, and a bit about reactive programming. Real-Time referring to soft real-time constraints usually in place for such systems.

Being an Open Source believer, I'm now sharing my lecture slides. I authored these, so no copyright/IP infringements here.
