I'm Alex. Most of the posts here started from the frustration of not finding what I need by googling stuff.

I hope the knowledge available here will be of use, not just for me.

Primarily the posts are about software engineering, Python, Elixir, Machine Learning (not the basic kind, neither the academic kind), and distributed systems.
