I work as a University Assistant at the Technical University of Moldova since September 2019,  lecturing 3 courses: Network Programming, Real-Time Programming, and Distributed Systems; plus mentored some students pursuing B.E.

I was lecturing specifically at the anglophone branch, called FAF. It's considered kind of a SpecOps academic group, with numerous perks and a selection process in place to pick who will get in there and who won't. Because of this, the courses were rewritten specifically for them, being much more fast-paced and covering substantially more material, plus the labs were hardcore.

All courses were significantly updated, but Real-Time Programming is a different topic entirely. The Real-Time Programming course didn't exist in the form I was teaching it, so I made it from scratch. Originally it was a course about event-driven programming in Windows, the Win32 API mind you. My version of Real-Time Programming is about asynchronous (and synchronous, a bit) message-driven communication, actor model, message brokers, and a bit about reactive programming. Real-Time referring to soft real-time constraints usually in place for such systems.

Being an Open Source believer, I'm now sharing my lecture slides. I authored these, so no copyright/IP infringements here.
