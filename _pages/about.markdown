Hi, I'm Alex.

I'm passionate about large scale systems, cutting edge machine learning, and tech. Basically, almost anything niche and that can be published at some big conference, or that impacts millions, or both, will sound interesting to me.

I work as Machine Learning Team Lead at Development Aid, my team automates data entry and applies NLP methods for knowledge mining. I'm describing it this vague because I'm not entirely sure I can dive into details of what and how am I doing things at work. So better safe than sorry. In our team we own everything, from managing the server to writing application code, testing and debugging.

I'm also a University Assistant at the Technical University of Moldova, where I teach students such things as concurrency, network protocols, actor model, messaging patterns, distributed systems, and so on.

<!-- I like to take full responsibility for projects and work on all levels of the technological stack, and along all the steps of the workflow. Love to mentor people and give feedback whenever needed. -->
